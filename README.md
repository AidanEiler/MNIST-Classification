# Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML), has become a more popular topic worldwide as recent innovations such as Large Language Models (LLMs) have become commonplace for personal, work, and educational use. Iâ€™ve analyzed five machine learning techniques ranging from classic ML to more modern approaches such as deep learning. I implemented five classification algorithms on the MNIST dataset, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Linear Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Results showed that modern ML algorithms outperform classic approaches. From my testing, CNN is more accurate and computationally efficient compared to KNN, with 98.71% and 97.15% accuracy in 118.96 seconds and 815.01 seconds, respectively.
